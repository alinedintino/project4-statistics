## Project Description
Reading in Homo Deus, the book by Yuval Noah Harari, the statement “War is obsolete; you are more likely to commit suicide than be killed in conflict...”, we found this statement interesting and wanted to deep dive into the data and understand whether the statement holds or not and to check if the author statement could be statistically proven.

## Questions & Hypotheses
- Are the suicides levels higher than the deaths in conflict levels? 
- are there regions or countries where that is not the case?
- are suicides levels among genders different?
- or suicide levels among different age groups?

## Dataset
- What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What is the source of your data? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.
- Deaths in conflict - ged201 dataset from Uppsala Conflict Data Program https://ucdp.uu.se/ 
- Deaths in conflict dataset explanation in https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/ged/ged201.pdf Years between 1989 and 2019, deaths on either sides of a conflict, as well as civilian deaths and unknown deaths.
- Suicides rates overview from Kaggle - dataset with data between 1989 and 2016. 
- Suicides dataset shows country, age group, gender, generation


## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other? Include a drawing or computer-generated image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of your database.
- Database has 2 tables, 1 Suicides table and 1 Conflict table. They are not connected with each other. The ERD Design is available in the repository.

## Workflow
Steps for the project:
- Create Trello board with plan
- Research the topic and find relevant datasets
- Create potential hypothesis 
- Data cleaning and data wrangling
- Code for hypothesis testing
- Putting together the information from the analysis into the presentation

## Organization
Trello board was used for tracking the plan and work done

What does your repository look like?
- Data folder
- gitignore file
- readme file
- analysis files.

## Links
Include relevant links (that point to google drive or data sources) to your repository, slides, data, database, ERD, and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
